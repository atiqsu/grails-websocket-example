I have ported over the concept into Grails and it does appear to be working fine, the additions was the Listener which is in src/groovy and dynamically added to web.xml using the _events.groovy in scripts folder...

Besides this everything else is as was on the tutorial 

I will also add the chat example into this so its the complete example as per instructions but now working under Grails :)
